The AI engineer successfully built a mobile-first, responsive retail grocery e-commerce store, , closely mirroring the design of . The development proceeded iteratively, starting with a basic frontend prototype using mock data. Key challenges involved precisely matching the Bacola theme's aesthetic, which required multiple rounds of design refinement and mobile optimization. The AI addressed user feedback by enhancing visual appeal, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment, and implementing a dedicated mobile bottom navigation. Syntax errors in JSX files during compilation were consistently identified and resolved. The final output is a comprehensive, frontend-only prototype, fully responsive and ready for backend integration.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to create a modern, mobile-first, and responsive retail grocery e-commerce store, , inspired by the  (). The initial phase requires building a frontend-only prototype with mock data, focusing on visual design, layout, and user experience.

Key requirements include:
*   **Design Replication:** Create a pixel-perfect clone of the Bacola theme, matching its design, layout, colors, fonts, images, animations, and structure. All interactive elements, navigation, and page transitions should appear identical.
*   **Mobile-First & Responsiveness:** The application must be mobile-first and accurately mirror the source website's responsive behavior across all devices. This includes proper mobile navigation (e.g., bottom navigation bar).
*   **Content:** Incorporate specific product categories and product data from .
*   **Functionality (Frontend-only):** All grocery commerce features (e.g., product display, category browsing, add to cart, wishlist, search, hero sliders, promotional banners, service features) are needed in the layout, using mock data. Interactive elements like buttons and forms should work as frontend elements, providing a functional teaser experience.
*   **Branding:** Replace Bacola branding with Kalagura Gampa.
*   **Technology Stack:** The overall application is a full-stack React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, but the current task is frontend-only.

The work completed so far is a fully responsive, pixel-perfect frontend prototype matching the Bacola theme, using mocked data from . It includes a top bar, main header, navigation, hero slider, product cards with quantity selectors, category grid, promotional banners, footer, and a mobile-specific bottom navigation bar.

The application has a full-stack architecture with a React frontend. The current work focuses entirely on the frontend.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for defining routes and integrating all major components.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a simple Hello World example. It was progressively updated to import and render the , , , , , ,  components. Later, it was significantly refactored to incorporate new Bacola-specific components (, , , , ) and the . It also handles routing for the home page.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global CSS styles for the application, including custom animations and typography.
    -   **Changes**: Initial modification to remove . Later, it was updated to include custom animations (, ) and other styling enhancements to improve visual appeal.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Imports Tailwind CSS directives and defines base layer styles, including CSS variables for dark/light themes and custom colors.
    -   **Changes**: No direct explicit changes were mentioned, but it's crucial for Tailwind and Shadcn theme application.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, defining custom colors, borderRadius, keyframes, and animations based on Shadcn's theme.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes were mentioned, implying the existing configuration was sufficient for the applied styles.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores all mock data for products, categories, hero slider items, and service banners. This file is crucial for enabling a fully functional frontend prototype without a backend.
    -   **Changes**: Created at the beginning of the task with initial mock data representing  products and Bacola-inspired promotional content.
-   ** (e.g., Header, HeroSlider, ProductCard, Footer, etc.)**:
    -   **Summary**: These files represent individual React components that build up the UI. They are highly modular and reusable.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Initial Creation**: A set of components (, , , , , , , ) were created to form the initial prototype.
        -   **Design Enhancement**: These components were heavily modified multiple times to refine styling, add gradients, shadows, and hover effects, and later to simplify them to match the actual Bacola aesthetic.
        -   **Mobile Optimization**: Further modifications were made to ensure responsiveness across different viewports, adjusting typography, layout (e.g., single column for ), and spacing.
        -   **Bacola Specific Components**: New components like , , , ,  were created and existing ones (, ) were effectively replaced or redesigned to achieve a pixel-perfect match with the Bacola theme.
        -   **MobileBottomNav.jsx**: A new component created specifically for mobile navigation, integrating five tabs (Home, Categories, Cart, Wishlist, Account).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Lists all frontend dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes were made to dependencies during the trajectory, as all necessary packages were pre-installed.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI backend entry point with basic API routes and MongoDB connection setup.
    -   **Changes**: No changes were made to the backend during this frontend-focused trajectory. It serves as a placeholder for future backend integration.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development:** Implement basic MongoDB models, essential CRUD endpoints, business logic, and error handling.
-   **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Replace frontend mock data with actual data from the backend API endpoints.
-   **Automated Frontend Testing:** Get explicit user permission to run .
-   **Brand Replacement**: Ensure all instances of Bacola in the codebase are replaced with Kalagura Gampa.
